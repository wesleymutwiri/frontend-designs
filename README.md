# Frontend Designs

This is a simple collection of different designs found on the internet recreated using only HTML and CSS with no frameworks, libraries or Javscript used.

The repo will continuously be updated so come back later for newer designs.

PS:
- The designs can be reused as you please. Since it is all HTML and CSS it can be used with any framework without much work.
- Also mobile responsiveness to be worked on slowly as most designs come without the mobile version.
- Also, the images will definitely not be the same. And I'll minimize the number of images I use because that's not the point. So yes, I'll just re-use one image for all img tags.
- Tutorials on how to recreate the sites from scratch to come soon on my [blog site](https://wesleyblog.netlify.app/)
  - Yes yes I know I'm a shameless plug. Sue me

## Reason

Honestly, no particular reason for doing the designs without use of Javascript other than getting to learn CSS better and create better designed sites.
